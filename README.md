# Translator

A powerful and efficient language translation tool developed in Python. The project leverages advanced translation APIs to provide real-time translations for users. This tool supports multiple languages and aims to offer seamless communication across linguistic boundaries.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support:** Translate text between various languages.
- **Real-Time Translations:** Instant translation results with a user-friendly interface.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple to integrate and extend with other APIs or language models.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Can be used across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for building interactive web applications. It is used for creating the frontend of the translator, handling user input and displaying results.
- **googletrans**: A Python library that interacts with Google Translate, enabling automatic language detection and text translation between various languages.
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: A library for converting text into speech using Googleâ€™s Text-to-Speech engine, used to generate and play audio of the translated text.
- **tempfile**: A standard Python library to create temporary files for saving and accessing the audio files generated by gTTS.
- **atexit**: A Python standard library for registering cleanup functions to remove temporary files when the program terminates.
- **os**: A standard Python library used for interacting with the operating system, in this case, to remove temporary files.
